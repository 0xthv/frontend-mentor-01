## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Normalize CSS 

### What I learned

- Learned how to use Grid for the general layout
- Used flexbox to align the two items in the button. Is that an overkill solution? 
- Learned the relative/absolute positioning. Used in the price section. 
- CSS variables 
- Normalize.css to remove default browser stylings 


### Useful resources

- [Fill div with image](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51487370) - That's the solution i've followed to understand how to fill the image container with the image itself.  

- [Using SRCSET](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/#aa-using-srcset-w-sizes) - My original idea was to use @media screen and (...) to serve different images depending on the device the user is using (is even possible to use only @media screen?). Seems like the current approach is to use Srcset in the html.
