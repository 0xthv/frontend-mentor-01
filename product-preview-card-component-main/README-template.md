## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Normalize CSS 

### What I learned

- Learned how to use Grid for the general layout
- Used flexbox to align the two items in the button. Is that an overkill solution? 
- Learned the relative/absolute positioning. Used in the price section. 
- CSS variables 
- Normalize.css to remove default browser stylings 


### Useful resources

- [Fill div with image](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51487370) - That's the solution i've followed to understand how to fill the image container with the image itself.  

- [Using SRCSET](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/#aa-using-srcset-w-sizes) - My original idea was to use @media screen and (...) to serve different images depending on the device the user is using (is even possible to use only @media screen?). Seems like the current approach is to use Srcset in the html.
